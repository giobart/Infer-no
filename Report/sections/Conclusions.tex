This project is publicly available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/laurab1/Infer-no} and can be exploited in order to assess Infer Quandary even further.
With our configuration, Quandary obtained a good sensitivity ($0.8$) with a low specificity ($0.4$). This depends on a precise choice, as it is always preferable to deal with false positives rather than false negatives. At the best of our knowledge, then, Quandary seems not to be a widely usable tool for web applications security at the moment being. \\
However, the obtained results are still promising, as they came without any refinement of the Quandary code, but only providing a configuration file. Providing the users with the possibility to define a more fine grained configuration may lead to better results, probably competing with those of best in class static analysis tools.
